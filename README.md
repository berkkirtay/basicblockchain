# Basic Blockchain Implementation 

A functional blockchain implementation in python. I will keep improving this library as I learn more about blockchain technology.
In the time being, this implementation works locally (by saving and loading database files in the local folder).

### Current components: 
- Blockchain library
- Test GUI
- Blockchain validators and transaction signatures
- P2P blockchain nodes (Still under development)
- Basic export and import module for blockchain data
- Blockchain based voting system and chat module
- Basic web-api for wallet interface with transactions and chat.
