# Basic Blockchain Implementation 

A functional blockchain implementation in python.
Currently I am trying to implement a proper p2p network to transfer blockchain data between peers.
In the time being, this implementation works locally (by saving and loading database files in the local folder)

### Current components: 
- A test script
- Test GUI 
- Basic database for blockchain and wallets
- Basic chat program based on blockchain
- P2p network for database transfer (haven't been tested yet)
- Basic web-api for wallet interface and transactions.
